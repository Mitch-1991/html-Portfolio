<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm a passionate and motivated beginner developer making an exciting career switch from the logistics industry. 
  After several years working in operations and supply chain, I discovered a strong interest in technology and problem-solving,
  which led me to start learning software development.
</p>

<p>While I'm at the start of my journey, I'm committed to building solid foundations in front-end and back-end development.
  I have started My Journey on Udemy With the help off Dr. Angela Yu from <a href="https://www.appbrewery.com/">The App Brewery</a>
  and I'm constantly learning through hands-on projects and continuous study.
</p>

<p>I'm excited to grow as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, 
  and eventually become part of a team that builds innovative digital solutions.
